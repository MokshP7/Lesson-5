                <h2>Dogs</h2>
                <p>The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also
                    called the domestic
                    dog, it was selectively bred from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by
                    hunter-gatherers. The
                    dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the development
                    of agriculture.
                    Experts estimate that due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive
                    on a starch-rich
                    diet that would be inadequate for other canids.</p>

                <h2>Facts of dogs</h2>
                <p>1. Dogs have sweat glands at the bottom of their paws (the paw pads). Hence, wetting their paws can help
                    on a hot summer
                    day.<br>
    
                    2. When dogs howl at each other, they adjust the pitch of the howl to sound more unique.<br>
    
                    3. In the dark, dogs use their whiskers to pick up subtle changes in the air currents. This gives them a
                    better
                    understanding of the environment and helps them “see” better in the dark.<br>
    
                    4. Despite popular belief, dogs don’t only see in black and white. In fact, they can see in blue, green,
                    yellow and gray
                    too.<br>
    
                    5. A dog’s nose is always wet because they help in absorbing certain scents. Furthermore, a dog will
                    lick the nose to
                    taste the scent.</p>
